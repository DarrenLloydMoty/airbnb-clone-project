## üß± Database Design

### Key Entities and Fields

#### 1. User
- `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`, `created_at`

#### 2. Property
- `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`, `host_id`, `available_dates`

#### 3. Booking
- `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`

#### 4. Review
- `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`

#### 5. Payment
- `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `transaction_date`

### Relationships
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**
- A **Booking** links a **User** and a **Property**
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property**
- A **Payment** is tied to a **Booking**

## üîê API Security

### Key Measures

- **Authentication**: Secure login using JWT or OAuth2.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access to resources (e.g., only hosts can update their properties).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse and brute-force attacks.
- **Input Validation**: Prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- **HTTPS**: Enforce encrypted data in transit.

Security is critical for protecting personal data, financial transactions, and maintaining trust.
