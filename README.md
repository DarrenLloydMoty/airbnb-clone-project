2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## Team Roles

### 1. Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing the application's core logic, APIs, and server-side functionality. Ensures proper communication between the frontend and the database, handles requests/responses, and implements business rules.

### 2. Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and maintains the database structure. Responsible for creating schemas, optimizing queries, managing backups, and ensuring data integrity and security.

### 3. DevOps Engineer
Manages the infrastructure and deployment pipeline. Sets up CI/CD processes, manages Docker containers, monitors performance, and ensures high availability and scalability.

### 4. Security Specialist
Implements application-level and API security. Focuses on authentication, authorization, encryption, rate limiting, and vulnerability assessments.


## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
Handles user registration, login, profile updates, and account security. Supports authentication and role-based access control for hosts and guests.

### 2. Property Management
Allows hosts to list properties with details such as price, availability, amenities, and images. Includes functionality to edit, update, or delete listings.

### 3. Booking System
Enables users to search for properties by location, date, or price. Supports making, modifying, and canceling bookings while managing property availability.

### 4. Review and Rating System
Guests can leave reviews and star ratings for properties they‚Äôve stayed in. Hosts can view feedback, helping build trust and improve quality.

### 5. Payment Integration
Securely processes user payments and handles booking charges. May include support for transaction history and refunds, integrating with external payment APIs.

### 6. Admin Dashboard (Optional but realistic)
Provides admin users with analytics and tools to manage users, listings, and reported issues within the system.



### 5. Project Manager / Team Lead
Coordinates the team, sets milestones, tracks progress, and ensures timely delivery. Acts as a bridge between the technical team and stakeholders, ensuring clear communication and accountability.



## API Security

To ensure the safety and integrity of user data and transactions, the backend APIs will include the following security measures:

### 1. Authentication
Only verified users can access the system using secure login mechanisms (e.g., JWT or OAuth2). This prevents unauthorized access.

### 2. Authorization
Role-based permissions control what actions a user can take. For example, only property owners can modify their listings.

### 3. Rate Limiting
Limits the number of requests per user or IP address to prevent abuse (e.g., brute-force attacks or DDoS attempts).

### 4. Input Validation and Sanitization
Prevents injection attacks (like SQL or XSS) by validating and cleaning user inputs before processing.

### 5. HTTPS Enforcement
All communications with the API will use HTTPS to protect data in transit from eavesdropping and tampering.

These security measures protect sensitive data such as user credentials, personal info, and payment transactions.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) help automate code testing and deployment, ensuring faster and more reliable development workflows.

### Tools:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates running tests and linting on every push or pull request.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application for consistency across environments.
- **(Optional) Heroku / Render / AWS**: Used to host and deploy the final version of the app.

### Benefits:
- Catches bugs early through automated testing.
- Ensures consistent deployment across environments.
- Speeds up release cycles and reduces manual errors.
